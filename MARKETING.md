It's a Chrome extension that makes reading the news slightly less painful.

Every time you see "Trump" it becomes:
- Orange Cheeto
- Mango Mussolini
- Cheeto Benito
- The Tangerine Tyrant

Plus you can add your own nicknames.

Hey r/chrome,

Just published my first Chrome extension. It's a text replacer that swaps "Trump" for humorous nicknames.

**Features:**
- 7 built-in nicknames (toggle individually)
- Custom nickname support
- 4 animation styles (shimmer, glow, pulse, none)
- Case preservation
- Hover to see original
- Badge counter
- Dark mode support
- Zero data collection

**Technical details:**
- Manifest V3
- MutationObserver for dynamic content
- TreeWalker for safe DOM traversal
- Chrome Storage Sync for settings

Looking for feedback on the implementation. Code is open source on GitHub.

### r/technology
**Title:** I built a Chrome extension for political satire - here's what I learned about browser extension development

**Post:**
```
Just shipped a Chrome extension that does text replacement across all websites. Thought I'd share some technical lessons learned:

**What it does:** Replaces "Trump" with various nicknames (Orange Cheeto, Mango Mussolini, etc.) with smooth animations.

**Technical challenges I solved:**

1. **Safe DOM traversal** - Can't just regex innerHTML. Used TreeWalker to skip scripts, styles, inputs, contenteditable.

2. **Case preservation** - TRUMP → ORANGE CHEETO, Trump → Orange Cheeto, trump → orange cheeto. Regex + conditional mapping.

3. **Dynamic content** - MutationObserver with debouncing to catch AJAX-loaded content without hammering performance.

4. **Animation performance** - CSS-only animations with will-change optimization. Respects prefers-reduced-motion.

5. **Manifest V3 migration** - Background pages are dead, long live service workers.

**What I'd do differently:**
- Would've used a bundler (just raw JS files currently)
- Would've added more unit tests

I built a Chrome extension for political satire. It automatically replaces "Trump" with nicknames like "Orange Cheeto," "Mango Mussolini," etc. across all websites.

Technical highlights:
- TreeWalker for safe DOM traversal (skips scripts, inputs, contenteditable)
- MutationObserver for dynamic content
- CSS-only animations with prefers-reduced-motion support
- Chrome Storage Sync for cross-device settings
- Zero external dependencies, plain JS

The code is pretty straightforward if anyone wants to fork it for their own text replacement use case.

Open to feedback on the implementation!
