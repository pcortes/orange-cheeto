# Privacy Policy for Orange Cheeto Chrome Extension

**Last Updated: January 2026**

## Overview

Orange Cheeto is a browser extension that replaces text on web pages for entertainment purposes. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect (spoiler: none) and how the extension works.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any data.** Period.

### What We DON'T Collect
- No personal information
- No browsing history
- No analytics or usage data
- No cookies or tracking
- No IP addresses
- No device information
- No account information

### What We DON'T Do
- We don't send any data to external servers
- We don't track which websites you visit
- We don't share anything with third parties
- We don't serve advertisements
- We don't sell or monetize your data in any way

## Local Storage

The extension stores your preferences (enabled nicknames, animation style, on/off state) using Chrome's built-in `chrome.storage.sync` API. This data:

- Is stored locally in your browser
- Syncs across your Chrome browsers if you're signed into Chrome (a built-in Chrome feature)
- Never leaves your browser or Google's infrastructure
- Can be deleted at any time by uninstalling the extension
- Is controlled entirely by you through the extension's settings

### Data Stored Locally
- Whether the extension is enabled or disabled
- Which nicknames are enabled or disabled
- Custom nicknames you've added
- Your selected animation style

**That's it.** No hidden data collection.

## Permissions Explained

The extension requests these permissions:

### "Read and change all your data on all websites" (host_permissions: <all_urls>)
This permission sounds scary but is required for the core functionality. The extension needs to:
- Read text on web pages to find words to replace
- Modify the page to show replacement text

**We do not:** Read or store any of your actual data, passwords, form inputs, or personal information.

### "Storage" (storage permission)
Used solely to save your extension settings locally in your browser.

### "ActiveTab" (activeTab permission)
Used to get the replacement count for the current tab to display in the extension badge.

## Third-Party Services

This extension does not integrate with any third-party services, APIs, or analytics platforms.

## Open Source

This extension is open source. You can review the complete source code to verify our privacy claims:

## Children's Privacy

This extension does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 (or any age, for that matter, since we collect nothing).

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever change this privacy policy, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top. However, since we collect no data, there's really nothing to change.

## Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy:
- Open an issue on our GitHub repository
- Email: [your email if you want to provide one]

## Summary

**TL;DR: We collect nothing. Your data stays on your device. The extension just replaces text for laughs.**
