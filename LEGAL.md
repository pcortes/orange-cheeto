## SATIRE AND PARODY DISCLAIMER

**Orange Cheeto is political satire and parody protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.**

This browser extension is a work of political commentary and satirical humor. It does not purport to state facts, defame any individual, or constitute commercial speech disparaging any person or entity.

The extension modifies how text appears on the user's own screen for personal entertainment purposes. It does not:
- Alter any website's actual content or databases
- Distribute modified content to third parties
- Create or publish any content attributed to any individual
- Interfere with any person's commercial interests
- Make false statements of fact about any individual

### Constitutional Protection

Political satire enjoys robust protection under the First Amendment. Key legal precedents establishing these protections include:

**Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U.S. 46 (1988)**
The Supreme Court unanimously held that public figures cannot recover damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress based on parody or satire, as long as the speech could not reasonably be understood as stating actual facts.

**New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964)**
Established that public officials (and later extended to public figures) face a heightened "actual malice" standard for defamation claims, requiring proof that the speaker knew the statement was false or acted with reckless disregard for truth.

**Cliffs Notes, Inc. v. Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group, 886 F.2d 490 (2d Cir. 1989)**
Parody that clearly identifies itself as such is protected, particularly when it comments on or criticizes the original subject.

**Cardtoons, L.C. v. Major League Baseball Players Ass'n, 95 F.3d 959 (10th Cir. 1996)**
Affirmed First Amendment protection for parody trading cards of celebrities, recognizing the important role parody plays in public discourse.

### Nature of the Content

1. **Obviously satirical** - No reasonable person would interpret these as literal factual claims
2. **Political commentary** - They express opinions about a public figure in the political arena
3. **Non-commercial** - The extension is free and the speech is not commercial advertising
